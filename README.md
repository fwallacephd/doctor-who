Notes about open source Doctor Who Project:

This site was created as an open source project for beginners by Faith H. Wallace, aka Code Girl.

The blog post about this project can be read here: https://codeburst.io/open-source-doctor-who-a666e2ab2d06

To see what the final project should look like, go here:

If you want to see the original code, a solution folder is included in this repository with the HTML and CSS codes (but try to write the code on your own first)

To get started:
1. First, click on the issues tab at the top of the repository.
2. Review the issues and choose something to work on.
3. Fork the respository (click the "Fork" at the top right corner).
4. Next, download the files and open the index.html and style.css in your text editor.
5. Make your changes!
6. Use the command line and Git to save your work and push to your repository.
