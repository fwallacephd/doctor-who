                                <p class="article-text">Doctor Who, a British television show that started in 1963, is an amalgamation of various
                                    genres including science fiction, fantasy, horror, and, sometimes, a healthy dose of
                                    fairy tale. The main character is The Doctor, an alien: a Time Lord from the Planet Gallifrey.
                                    The Doctor travels through time and space in his TARDIS, a type of space ship that is
                                    sentient and has chameleon powers (although currently stuck as an old-school police call
                                    box). TARDIS stands for Time and Relative Dimensions in Space and is famous for being
                                    “bigger on the inside.”</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="article-text">The Doctor travels with companions, usually a female companion, and embarks on grand adventures
                                    often saving people and planets from imminent doom. A key element of Doctor Who is that
                                    The Doctor does not believe in violence. He does not carry a gun. Instead, he has a sonic
                                    screwdriver, a scientific instrument with countless capabilities, along with psychic
                                    paper. The Doctor is clever, mad, and passionate about humans, going to great lengths
                                    to save us, sometimes from aliens, and sometimes, from ourselves.</p>

                                <p class="article-text"> A major plot device in Doctor Who is the regeneration capabilities of Time Lords. Meaning,
                                    when the Time Lord dies, he regenerates into an entirely new version of himself (i.e.,
                                    a new actor). The regeneration process has allowed the show to continue to reinvent itself
                                    over decades with a total of 12 incarnations of The Doctor thus far (14 if you count
                                    both the War Doctor and the new Doctor: Jodie Whittaker, the first female Doctor).</p>

                                <p class="article-text">My journey with Doctor Who started with what is considered the “new” series. The “classic”
                                    series starts with the initial run of the show in 1963 all the way through the 1996 television
                                    movie. The “new” series begins with the “reboot” in 2005, famously brought back to life
                                    by Russell T. Davies. Thus far, The Doctor, in the new series, has been played by Christopher
                                    Eccleston (#9), David Tennant (#10), Matt Smith (#11), John Hurt (The War Doctor), Peter
                                    Capaldi (#12), and, now, Jodie Whittaker (#13), the first female Doctor.</p>
                                <p class="article-text">Top 5 Episodes:</p>
                                <p class="article-text">You may notice a trend or two… Four of the five episodes were written by Stephen Moffat,
                                    and The Doctor is portrayed by David Tennant in four of the five episodes. This list
                                    is not in a heirarchy. It is virtually impossible for me to choose which of these episodes
                                    is my ultimate favorite above all others.

                                    a forgotten regeneration who must make the ultimate sacrifice of his own people to stop
                                    the Time War, a deadly war with the murderous Daleks. But things don’t go as planned,

                                    the 10th (David Tennant) and the 11th (Matt Smith) Doctor. Can the three Doctors find

                                <p class="article-text"><em>The Eleventh Hour</em> is the introduction to the 11th Doctor, Matt Smith. In this adventure,
                                    The Doctor lands in the backyard of a little girl, Amelia Pond, who happens to have an
                                    alien prisoner loose in her home. Before The Doctor can sort out the mystery of Prisoner
                                    Zero, he takes his TARDIS for a quick spin, promising to come back in 5 minutes, which
                                    turns out to be 12 years. Amelia, now Amy, traumatized from this brief encounter does
                                    not trust The Doctor. But The Doctor desperately needs Amy’s help before the alien race,
                                    The Atraxi, destroy the planet to retrieve Prisoner Zero.

                                <p class="article-text">The success of the episode <em>Blink</em> (often touted as the ultimate fan favorite episode)
                                    is impressive given this is a “Doctor-lite” episode. Meaning, The Doctor has a very small,
                                    albeit critical, part to play in the episode. The adventure surrounds Sally Sparrow who
                                    comes in contact with the Weeping Angels, a race of aliens that are Quantum Locked and
                                    can only move when you are not looking at them. The angels are terrifying, and they are
                                    out to steal the TARDIS while destroying the lives of Sally and her companions at the
                                    same time. Fans of Doctor Who often quote this episode with the following lines: “Don’t

                                <br>
                                <p class="article-text">In this two-parter, the Doctor and his companion, Martha, are running from a dangerous alien
                                    enemy, The Family of Blood. To hide, The Doctor becomes “human” and both he and Martha
                                    hide out at a school for boys during 1913. The Doctor becomes a mild-mannered teacher
                                    who develops romantic feelings for a nurse at the school (with no memories of his life
                                    as a Time Lord). Martha takes on the job as a maid in the school while watching over
                                    The Doctor. The Family of Blood eventually find them and attack the school and the children.
                                    The Doctor must make the ultimate choice of remaining human or becoming a Time Lord once
                                    again to defeat his enemies. Tennant’s performance is incredible, showing the duality
                                    of his personas – the human and the Time Lord – and the sacrifices he makes to save humans.
                                    This episode is best known for the following exchange which highlights the awesomeness
                                    of The Doctor's fury:

                                    a dwaf star. He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy. To be
                                    imprisoned there...forever. He still visits my sister, once a year, every year. I wonder
                                    if one day he might forgive her... but there she is. Can you see? He trapped her inside
                                    a mirror. Every mirror. If ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind
                                    you just for a second, that's her. That's *always* her. As for me, I was suspended in
                                    time and the Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England as their protector.

                                    The Doctor and companion, Donna Nobile, arrive on a planet, a library. The grandest library
                                    in all of space and time, but no one is there; the library is empty, and something is
                                    shutting off the lights. They receive just one cryptic warning: count the shadows! The

                                    library, River appears to know The Doctor. It fact, it was River that summoned The Doctor
                                    to the planet using psychic paper. The problem is that The Doctor has not actually met
                                    River yet. They are operating under different time lines. We learn their terrible fate:
                                    his first encounter with River is her last encounter with The Doctor. River refuses to
                                    divulge any further information about their relationship, and quips, “Spoilers.” With

                                            five decades. Regeneration began when the original actor playing The Doctor became
                                            ill and had to leave. Thus, the concept of regeneration was born. Inserted into
                                            the cannon of the show was the notion that Time Lords, mortally injured or deathly
                                            ill, could regenerate into a new version of himself. The new version would of
                                            course be a new actor, and The Doctor would now take on a completely different
                                            look, speech, personality, and basically, different DNA. </p>

                                        <p class="article-text">
                                            Throughout the series, The Doctor has always regenerated into a man, a white man, but audiences were treated to a surprise
                                            with the character of Missy: Missy was really the regenerated version of The
                                            Master, The Doctor’s nemesis and best friend. A new element of regeneration was
                                            then inserted into the cannon: Time Lords can change gender during regeneration.
                                            As audiences waited to hear which actor would replace Peter Capaldi, the 12th
                                            Doctor, rumors about a female Doctor took shape. Those rumors rang true when
                                            it was revealed that Jodie Whittaker would be taking on the role as the 13th
                                            Doctor. This is exciting new territory for Doctor Who. At the time of writing
                                            this post, fans eagerly await learning the identity of The Doctor’s new companion.
